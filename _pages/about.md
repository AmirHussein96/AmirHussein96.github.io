I'm a PhD student at [Johns Hopkins University](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ece), working in the [Center for Language and Speech Processing](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu), advised by [Prof. Sanjeev Khudanpur](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/faculty/sanjeev-khudanpur). I was also a [JHU–Amazon AI2AI Fellow](https://ai2ai.engineering.jhu.edu/2024-2025-ai2ai-fellows) during 2024–2025.

My research focuses on building **real-time speech translation** models that can handle **conversational** and **long-form** speech, as well as multimodal representation learning. I have also worked on problems involving multilingual, code-switched, and low-resource ASR, along with neural audio codecs.

I completed my Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [American University of Beirut](https://www.aub.edu.lb/), where I was advised by [Prof. Hazem Hajj](https://www.aub.edu.lb/pages/profile.aspx?memberId=hh63) and was a member of the [AUB MIND Lab](https://sites.aub.edu.lb/mindlab/members/alumni/). My research there focused on time series and sensing analytics, domain adaptation, and multitask learning. Following my master’s studies, I worked as a Machine Learning Consultant at [Kanari.ai](https://kanari.ai) under the supervision of [Dr. Ahmed Ali](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmedali08).
